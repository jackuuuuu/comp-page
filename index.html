            Avocato: Are you sure to do this? There's a 99% chance that this is a trap. Gary: Traps are just open casting calls for heroes. Plus, you already tied up Quinn, so there's no real rebound after that. Avocato: You're a good friend. Gary: I would've gone with great. But whatever. I'll take good. Avocato: What is happening Gary: I think we're about to hug. Avocato: Should we? Gary: The siren's call is beckoning us to embrace. We shan't ignore her. [he hugs Avocato] Hell, yeah. Avocato: Thanks, bud. Needed that. Gary: Let's get your boy back. Mooncake: [comes in and laughs] Chookity! Gary: Mooncake, we're gonna need rich sacks of back up. We're goin' down to the Lord Commander's prison colony. It's dangerous! It's life-threatening! We're probably gonna die. I You got my back, little buddy? Mooncake: Chookity! Gary: I didn't really sell that very well, did I? Crap! So no back up. Just two hombres with a dream, let's do this. [before Avocato's death] Avocato: As excited as I am about today, I'm even more excited for tomorrow. Little Cato: Yeah. Avocato: [gasps] No! Gary: No. Avocato: Take care of my boy. Little Cato: No! D-Dad! [the area explodes and Avocato's dies]
